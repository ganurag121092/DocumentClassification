# DocumentClassification
Machine Learning Project for Document Classification
-------------------------------------------------------

Our project uses a publicly available DataSet containing various number of documents along with the names of the Conferences in which these documents were presented.

The aim of the project Document Classification is use different Supervised Machine Learning Techniques and compare the accuracy and efficiency of different techniques.

I have used SciKit-Learn package which defines LinearSVC which is one of the major algorithms in implementing Support Vector Machine mechanism on this dataset.
